Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell.
You there. You and me -- we should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
Shut up back there!
And what's wrong with him?
Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.
Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.
Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?
Why do you care?
A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
Rorikstead. I'm...I'm from Rorikstead.
General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
Good. Let's get this over with.
Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in.
Funny...when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.
End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
No! Wait! We're not rebels!
Face your death with some courage, thief.
You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!
Step toward the block when we call your name. One at a time!
Empire loves their damn lists.
It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!
No, I'm not a rebel! You can't do this!
You're not going to kill me!
Anyone else feel like running?
Wait, you there. Step forward. Who are you?
Captain, what should we do? He's not on the list.
Forget the list. He goes to the block.
By your orders, captain.
Follow the Captain, prisoner.
Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his throne.
You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos and now the Empire is going to put you down, and restore the peace.
What was that?
It's nothing. Carry on.
For the love of Talos, shut up and lets get this over with.
You Imperial bastards!
Death to the Stormcloaks!
As fearless in death as he was in life.
There it is again. Did you hear that?
I said, next prisoner!
To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.
What in Oblivion is that?
Sentries! What do you see?
It's in the clouds!
Dragon!
Don't just stand there, kill that thing! Guards, get the townspeople to safety!
Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?
Legends don't burn down villages. We need to move, now!
Get back!
Tell my family I fought bravely!
It's you and me, prisoner, stay close!
Die, dragon!
How in Oblivion do we kill this thing? Just...die!
You damned traitor, out of my way!
I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.
If you want to die, so be it.
Look out! Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.
A torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these...
Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!
You have no authority over me, boy.
Grab everything important and let's move! The dragon is burning everything to the ground.
I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon!
It would take more than a dragon to stop Ulfric Stormcloak.
A dragon? That's...ridiculous. You aren't drunk, are you, boy?
Here's the situation. A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.
Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.
Talos save us! It's a dragon!
Slay it! Slay the dragon!
I can't believe it! You're...Dragonborn...
Fus Ro Dah!
I'm not a man, I'm a weapon in human form. Just unsheathe me and point me at the enemy.
No lollygagin'.
Some may call this junk, me, I call them treasures.
May you die with a sword in your hand.
I'd be a lot happier and a lot warmer with a belly full of mead.
I am sworn to carry your burdens.
Victory or Sovengard!
Got to start carrying a dagger in my boot. I'm tired of getting disarmed.
My favorite drinkin buddy! Lets get some mead!
My father said I should go to college but he didnt say which one.
I heard about you and your honeyed words.
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
Can't wait to count out your coin.
Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?
It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense.
I had an uncle, you see. He made certain... unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then I killed again. And liked it even more.
What is better - to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
Would you like a bow that shoots rainbows too? Or perhaps a quiver that dispenses beer?
I need to ask you to stop... That... shouting.
So begins a contract... bound... in BLOOD.
They got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards in Windhelm: Suicide.
You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee.
See those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
Let me guess: Someone stole your sweetroll.
I got to thinking. Maybe I'm the Dragonborn, I just don't know it yet.
You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of dovah.
You stink of death, my friend. I salute you.
I’ll kill you if I have to!
What are you hunting? Never mind… I don’t want to know.
My cousin’s out fighting dragons and what do I get? Guard duty
So, you wish to master the arcane arts.
Dragonborn, huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?
I look forward to hearing about the next person you murder!
Kill one person, and you can solve so many problems. I wonder at the possibilities.
You’re either the bravest person i’ve ever met… or the biggest fool.
Ummm… you got no clothes. You should get some.
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin
Khajiit stole nothing
Khajiit is innocent of this crime
Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
Gotta keep my eyes open. Damn dragons could swoop down at any time.
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.
Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...
The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous.
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling.
It's a werewolf! To arms! To arms!
Iron sword, huh? What are you killing, butterflies?
Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I wouldn't do for a set of that.
You dare strut around here, wearing that filthy Stormcloak hide?
Ugh. That armor stinks of death. You been grave robbing?
Who did you have to kill to get that blade?
I know Thieves Guild armor when I see it. You're not fooling anyone.
Winterhold belongs to Skyrim, not the Imperials, or the Mages.
You don't seem to realize there's a war on. What you are is a damn Imperial spy!
You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.
What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?
You here to see the Jarl? No sudden moves, understand?
Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.
By order of the Jarl, stop right there!
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
Wait... I know you.
Alright now. Everyone back away. Let the law handle this.
If anyone saw anything, step forward. Otherwise, step away from the body.
You shouldn't leave weapons laying around. Someone could get hurt. And if I see you do it again, that someone will be you. Have I made myself clear?
